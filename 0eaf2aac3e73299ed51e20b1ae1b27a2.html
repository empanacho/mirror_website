    I like the idea of doing impossible things.
    I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
    I like to try and make it real.
    Would you partake?

                        I hate the interview process now more than ever. Almost all the response to my applications are templates.<br/>
                        I understand that sometimes companies have so many applications to review but I think it's better not to reply and assume that you are not goog enough.<br/>
                        I hate because now I cannot appreciate that reply from <a href="https://oxide.computer/">Oxide.Computer</a>. All I'm thinking in is <b>this is just a template.</b><br/><br/>
                        I wasn't expecting any answer from them. <br/>
                        I'm stupid. <br/>
                        I have zero skills for them. <br/>
                        I just applied to share my feelings about a post from their blog and how it hits me very hard in the core. It made me believe in the industry again.<br/><br/>
                        I hate myself even more for not allowing myself to doubt that maybe they did mean to reply that and it's not another template.
