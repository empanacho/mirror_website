    I like the idea of doing impossible things.
    I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
    I like to try and make it real.
    Would you partake?

            <p>These are things in my head, don't take them too seriously. Bear in mind that, actually, I have no idea what I am saying.</p>

            <h2>A Broken Process</h2>

            <p>
                I have had a lot of interviews. Most of them were the usual process. Some of them were interesting. And just a few of them were quite interesting. The funny thing is that the ones were I succeded had nothing to do with technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                My belief is that was either my charism or the blind faith of the people that interviewed me. Maybe both. No idea but it makes me think that perhaps nobody really knows how to hire the right people.

                It reminds of the process of submit a research paper. There are stories where main scientific theories were rejected by respected journals that the authors were forced to published in less known journals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe it all comes down to the biases of each interviewer? Dunno.
