    I like the idea of doing impossible things.
    I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
    I like to try and make it real.
    Would you partake?

            <h2>An Independent Scientist</h2>

            <p>
                I'm probably using the term <em>independent scientist</em><label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle">
            <span class="sidenote left">
                I wasn't awared that the word <em>scientist</em> was modeled after the word artist. I find that quite fine since in higher layers I see an artist and a scientist as the same thing.
            </span> wrong but what I mean by that is that:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>
                    A being or entity who studies nature/reality and tries to follow a procedure in search for the most possible objective explanation of the phenomena in place and where the only expected
                    reward is the resolution itself and nothing more.
                </em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>That I think I have become, <b>an independent scientist.</b></p>
