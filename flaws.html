<!--
    I like the idea of doing impossible things.
    I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
    I like to try and make it real.
    Would you partake?
    Contact me.

                        <em>
                            I tend to shut myself up and my anger/rage builds up to the point I'm not productive:
                        </em>
                        I think the reason is... how can I blame someone when I clearly I could do something worse but i try to make your emotions understand that...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I have the ability to hyperfocus but I can't command it:
                        </em>
                        It depends on music, purely electronic and siwth some cyclic patterns and coding. Other activities do nothing.

                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I enjoy people in very, very short amounts of time:
                        </em>
                        I get bored. It's not people's fault but rather that I'm poorly made.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                        I'm way too idealistic:
                        </em>
                        I find impossible things very appealing so I aim to that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I hate myself:
                        </em>
                        Most of the time my stupidity doesn't pay off so...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                        I love myself too much:
                        </em>
                        But when I'm not hating myself, I'm very happy with myself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                        I think I'm a narcisist but very functional one:
                        </em>
                        This mostly an insight that I cannot see but I trust the people who pointed it out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                        I rarely ask for help:
                        </em>
                        It's not about pride. I just like impossible things and I get obsessed with them that I forgot about asking for help.

                        <em>
                            I tend to be the stand up guy:
                        </em>
                        but I think it's because deep down I want to be the hero.

                        <em>
                            I'm not sure about anything:
                        </em>
                        I blame my training in physics.

                            I'm not smart, not even average:
                        </em>
                        I have reference from smart people and I know how average I am.

                        <em>
                            I usually don't give myself credit:
                        </em>
                        I think it's because I have a tendency to go against authorities.

                            I'm very selfish:
                        </em>
                        After 30 yrs on this planet, I have concluded it's the only way, for me, to cope with reality.

                        I'm very pessimistic:

                        My pessimism is the fuel of my optimism.

                            I get bored a lot:
                        </em>
                        This most likely is a brain issue.

                        </em>
                        Probably an existential one.

                        When you are not handsom, all you have is artificial aesthetics.
