<!--
    I like the idea of doing impossible things.
    I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
    I like to try and make it real.
    Would you partake?
    Contact me.

            <h2>Things I believe</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I think everyone has something to offer and they are always open to do that.
                        </em>
                        The problem is there are so many things affecting us that we tend to be mean to each other, however, this means I believe humans have a good heart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            Any one has the capacity to become awesome at something.
                        </em>
                        The reasons why people look for expertise, in the end, I believe, has nothing to do with the actual matter. I rather collaborate with someone up for a challange that some expert on the matter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            We need one another.
                        </em>
                        Anyone can do things on its own perhaps not everything. However, I believe doing things together makes the experience more fun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            You are going to fail.
                        </em>
                        And so will I. That's the way it is and I'm fine with the logic behind. Do fail. By all means, do it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I'm an open book. I trust you by default.
                        </em>
                        And if you decide to break that trust, that's alright. You will save some time. I'm all about creating long lasting friendships and time is of the essence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            There are social conventions, social cues and sugar coding. I don't understand any of them.
                        </em>
                        Just be straight with me. I won't get offended. Otherwise, there will be misunderstanding. I guarantee that.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Flaws</h2>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I enjoy people in very, very short amounts of time:
                        </em>
                        I get bored. It's not people's fault but rather that I'm poorly made. After a few decades on the planet I finally know why. The reason why I can't be too much around people is because I'm happy. And when I'm happy my baggage, my traumas as a child, push me away as a defense mechanism. I don't want to lose that happiness. I don't want to lose that people in my life. This is quite sad since I cannot fix that. I can only cope with it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                        I'm way too idealistic:
                        </em>
                        I find impossible things very appealing so I aim to that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I hate myself:
                        </em>
                        Most of the time my stupidity doesn't pay off so...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I tend to be the stand up guy:
                        </em>
                        but I think it's because deep down I want to be the hero. Because heroes get to be loved and accepted. And I, as I have discovered, was rejected since early childhood and in so I have no place where I feel at home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I'm not sure about anything:
                        </em>
                        I blame my training in physics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                        I'm very pessimistic:
                        </em>
                        My pessimism is the fuel of my optimism.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I get bored a lot:
                        </em>
                        This most likely is a brain issue. A brain issue what was fixed at early stage of childhood.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            I need to be busy:
                        </em>
                        I used to believe it was an existential reason but now I know it's because my childhood trauma.
                    </li>

                        <em>
                        I care how I dress:
                        </em>
                        Well, I do. I enjoy fashion as an art.
                    </li>
